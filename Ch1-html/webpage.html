            <strong>You can wear pashminas in different ways. Some of the ways are:</strong>
            
            <ol type = "i">
                
                <li><em><strong>Wear your pashmina as a shawl</strong></em>: When it gets a little chilly, drape your pashmina around your shoulders. You can let the ends hang loosely in front of you or throw one end over the opposite shoulder.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Make a full shawl wrap</strong></em>: Drape the pashmina around you, like a shawl, and then tie the ends in front of your chest. This style keeps the shawl from falling off your shoulders.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Wear your pashmina in a European way</strong></em>: Fold the pashmina in half and drape it around your neck. Bring the loose ends through the loop at the other end and pull them through for a snug fit. Leave the ends hanging in front of you or tuck them into your coat.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Make an artistic knot</strong></em>: Slide the wrap around your neck and make both sides equal length. Tie a loose knot in the middle of the right side and pass the left side through it. Tighten the knot.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Wear your pashmina as a head scarf</strong></em>: Place it over your head and either knot the ends at the nape of your neck or let the loose pieces drape around your neck and shoulders. If you don't feel comfortable pulling off such a dramatic look, fold the pashmina shawl in half and wear it more as a head band, allowing your hair to flow beneath it.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Create a shorter scarf</strong></em>: Crease and fold the pashmina lengthwise three or four times. Wrap it around your neck once or twice and let the ends hang down. You can also tie the ends together for added security.</li>
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Dress up your coat</strong></em>: Fold the fabric four times lengthwise and drape it around your shoulders under the collar of your coat. If you are not wearing a coat, you can leave the ends hanging in front of you or toss one end over your shoulder.</li>
                
                <br>
                
                <li><em><strong>Slip on a sarong</strong></em>: Wrap the scarf around your waist and tie the ends together at the hip. Wear this sarong over fitted pants, a skirt or a dress.</li>
        
            </ol>
